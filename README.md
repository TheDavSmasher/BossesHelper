# Bosses Helper

**Current Version**: `1.1.4`

---

This is a helper specifically designed to allow the creation of custom bosses within a Celeste map, fully customizable through input in the map editor or utilizing user-provided .xml and .lua files to execute attacks, cutscenes, and more.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/TheDavSmasher/BossesHelper/wiki) for more documentation and examples.

## Disclaimer

Currently, I have referenced and used code from Ricky06's Conqueror's Peak, Cruor's LuaCutscenes, and IsaGoodFriend's BadelineFollower, all of which either have their code under license or have explicitly allowed me to do code reference and copying. All other code is original or from Vanilla Celeste.
